```

## Problem 1

Read and clean df
```{r}
homicide_df = 
  read_csv("./data/homicide-data.csv") %>% 
  mutate(
    resolved = case_when(
      disposition == "Closed without arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Open/No arrest" ~ "unsolved",
      disposition == "Closed by arrest" ~ "solved"
    ),
    city_state = str_c(city, state, sep = "_")
  ) %>% 
  select(city_state, resolved) %>% 
  filter(city_state != "Tulsa_AL")
```

create aggregate df
```{r}
aggregate_df = 
  homicide_df %>% 
    group_by(city_state) %>% 
    summarize(
      hom_total = n(),
      hom_unsolved = sum(resolved == "unsolved")
    ) 
```

run prop test for 1 city
```{r}
prop.test(
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_unsolved),
  aggregate_df %>% filter(city_state == "Baltimore_MD") %>% pull(hom_total)
) %>% broom::tidy()
```

itterate over all the cities
```{r}
aggregate_df %>% 
  mutate(
    prop_test = map2(.x = hom_unsolved, .y = hom_total, ~prop.test(x = .x, n = .y)),
    tidy_test = map(prop_test, ~broom::tidy)
  ) %>% pull(tidy_test)
```
